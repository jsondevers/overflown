## A place for overflowed thoughts and ideas

This is a place for overflowed thoughts and ideas. It is a place for myself (and potentially others) to write down thoughts and ideas, and to share them with the world. I've always felt overwhelmed by the amount of things I want to learn and do, and I hope this will help me organize my thoughts and ideas and act as a brain dump for myself. I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them.

## The Beauty of 2

I have always loved the number 2 and I wrote a paper that was not for a class or anything but because I've been thinking about it for awhile. I structured it like a proof because I wanted to now connect my love for the number to computer science. I hope you enjoy it!
