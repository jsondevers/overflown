# Vim

## What is Vim?

Vim is a text editor that is available on most Unix-like systems. It is a clone of the [Vi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi) text editor, which was originally developed for the Unix operating system. Vim is designed to be a highly configurable text editor, and is often used for programming, though it can be used to edit any plain text.

I've been trying to use Vim more and more, and here are some cool sites I've found:

1. [Best Practices for IDE users](https://betterprogramming.pub/50-vim-mode-tips-for-ide-users-f7b525a794b3)
2. [Offical Cheat Sheet](https://vimhelp.org/quickref.txt.html)
3. [Vim Tutor](https://vimhelp.org/quickref.txt.html)
4. [Vim Commands Index](https://vimhelp.org/index.txt.html)
5. [Learn Vim the smart way](https://learnvim.irian.to/)

### TODO

1. [ ] Commands Cheatsheet
2. [ ] Actually learn vim
