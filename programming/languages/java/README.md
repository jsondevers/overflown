## Generics

Consider the following code:

```java
public class Tree<V extends Serializable & Comparable<V>>
```

- "The bound shown here requires that the value type V is comparable to itself, in other words, that it implements the Comparable interface directly. This rules out the use of types that inherit the Comparable interface from a superclass."

- This came up in one of my classes, and I was wondering why the use of "extends" rather than "implements".

Perhaps that last phrase explains why the use of "extends" rather than "implements",
