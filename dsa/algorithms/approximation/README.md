# Approximation Algorithms

## Introduction

An approximation algorithm is an algorithm that finds an approximate solution to a problem, rather than an optimal solution. An approximation algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm that produces a solution that is guaranteed to be within some factor of the optimal solution.
