# Proofs

This was heavily influenced from [MIT's Mathmatics for Computer Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/) and was one of my favorite courses.

## Proofs should be

1. Complete - The proof should be complete, meaning that it should
   prove the proposition completely and without any gaps. If the proof
   is incomplete, then it is possible that the proposition is true, but
   the proof does not show that it is true. If the proof is complete,
   then the proposition is either true or false, but the proof shows
   that it is true.
2. Correct - The proof should be correct, meaning that it should
   prove the proposition correctly. If the proof is incorrect, then it
   is possible that the proposition is false, but the proof shows that
   it is true. If the proof is correct, then the proposition is either
   true or false, but the proof shows that it is true.
3. Brief - The proof should be brief, meaning that it should be as
   short as possible. If the proof is long, then it is possible that
   the proposition is true, but the proof does not show that it is
   true. If the proof is brief, then the proposition is either true or
   false, but the proof shows that it is true.
4. "Elegant" - The proof should be elegant, meaning that it should
   be as simple as possible. If the proof is complicated, then it is
   possible that the proposition is true, but the proof does not show
   that it is true. If the proof is elegant, then the proposition is
   either true or false, but the proof shows that it is true.
5. Well Organized - The proof should be well organized, meaning that
   it should be organized in a way that is easy to understand. If the
   proof is poorly organized, then it is possible that the proposition
   is true, but the proof does not show that it is true. If the proof
   is well organized, then the proposition is either true or false, but
   the proof shows that it is true.
6. Inorder - The proof should be inorder, meaning that it should be
   in a logical order. If the proof is out of order, then it is
   possible that the proposition is true, but the proof does not show
   that it is true. If the proof is inorder, then the proposition is
   either true or false, but the proof shows that it is true.

"Good proofs are like good code and good code should be able to be proved correct."

You are writing software that could depend on someone's life.

## Definitions

Create a table for definitions.

Definition | Meaning | Example
--- | --- | ---
Proposition | A statement (communication) that is either true or false. | (TODO)
Axiom | An axiom is a proposition that is assumed to be true without proof. | (TODO)
Predicate | A predicate can be understood as a proposition whose truth depends on the value of one or more variables. | (TODO)
Theorem | Important true propositions are called theorems. | (TODO)
Lemma | A lemma is a preliminary proposition useful for proving later propositions. | (TODO)
Corollary | A corollary is a proposition that follows in just a few logical steps from a theorem. | (TODO)
Implication | Propositions of the form “If P, then Q” are called implications. This implication is often rephrased as “P IMPLIES Q.” | (TODO)
Conjunction | Propositions of the form “P AND Q” are called conjunctions. This conjunction is often rephrased as “P AND Q.” | (TODO)
Disjunction | Propositions of the form “P OR Q” are called disjunctions. This disjunction is often rephrased as “P OR Q.” | (TODO)
Negation | Propositions of the form “NOT P” are called negations. This negation is often rephrased as “NOT P.” | (TODO)
Proof | A *mathematical* proof of a proposition is a chain of *logical deductions* leading to the proposition from a base set of *axioms*. | (TODO)
